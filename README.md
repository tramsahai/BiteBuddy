BiteBuddy is a fun and interactive Android app designed to help users quickly decide what to eat. By entering the time of day, the app suggests meals ranging from breakfast to after-dinner snacks. The goal is to make meal planning simple, stress-free, and enjoyable.

## Purpose of the App
The purpose of BiteBuddy is to:
- Remove the stress of deciding what to eat.
- Provide quick, time-based meal suggestions.
- Keep the experience engaging with motivational messages.

If the user types in an incorrect input, the app responds with a friendly error message and prompts them to try again.

## Design Considerations

### User Interface (UI)
- Minimal layout with one main input field and results area.
- Clean design that is simple and easy to navigate.
- A reset button lets users clear everything with one tap.

### User Experience (UX)
- Quick interaction: type the time of day â†’ get meal suggestions.
- Friendly error messages instead of app crashes.
- Designed to be intuitive for first-time users.

### Technical Design
- Language: Kotlin
- Framework: Android Studio
- Compatibility: minSdk 21, compileSdk 35
- Build system: Gradle
- Organized project structure with:
  - MainActivity.kt (logic)
  - res/layout/ (UI layout)
  - res/drawable/ (images/backgrounds)

## GitHub Usage
- All project files are stored in a GitHub repository.
- Commits track progress and code changes.
- Version control ensures nothing is lost.
- Errors during pushing (such as non-fast-forward issues) were solved by syncing branches, which helped strengthen version control skills.
- GitHub serves as a backup and collaboration tool.

## GitHub Actions
While the current project is small, GitHub Actions can be used to:
- Automate builds to check that the app compiles correctly.
- Run tests to confirm input and error handling work as expected.
- Generate APKs automatically.
- Run linting and code quality checks to ensure consistent code.

This makes development smoother and more reliable as the project grows.

## Conclusion
BiteBuddy is a lightweight but practical app that helps users make meal choices in a simple and interactive way. Its design is minimal, user-friendly, and effective.
