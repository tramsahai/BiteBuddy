# BiteBuddy üç¥

**BiteBuddy** is a fun and interactive Android app designed to help users quickly decide what to eat during busy days. By entering the time of day, the app provides meal suggestions ranging from breakfast to after-dinner snacks, making meal planning simple, engaging, and enjoyable.

## Project Structure

The **BiteBuddy** project contains a main Android module located in the `app/` directory. Inside `app/`, the `src/main/` folder holds the Kotlin source file `MainActivity.kt` under `java/com/example/bitebuddy/`, as well as the `res/` directory for resources. The `res/` folder includes `layout/activity_main.xml` for the app‚Äôs user interface and a `drawable/` directory for any graphics or backgrounds. The module also has its own Gradle build file named `build.gradle.kts`.  

At the project level, there is a `build.gradle.kts` file for overall project configuration, a `settings.gradle.kts` file to define project settings, and this `README.md` file that provides documentation and guidance for the project.

## Features

- **Time-based meal suggestions**: Type in a time of day (e.g., Morning, Afternoon, Dinner) and get meal ideas.
- **Fun and engaging UI**: Vibrant design with emojis to make meal planning enjoyable and interactive.
